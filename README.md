Operation๑ is an operation defined by me.


The number pair (x,y) can be obtained by operation๑ as number pair (x',y'), written as ๑(/u0e51 in unicode) (x,y)=(x',y'), where x'=ax+by, y'=ax-by, (a,b are constants)

Note: Due to a mistake on my part, the source packaged files downloaded in realeases are out of sync. Please download the calculator and use the Edit Source function to solve it (from v1.0.6 version has been noted)

Since I've been diving into C++ lately, this project has gone into a slow-maintenance phase:(
